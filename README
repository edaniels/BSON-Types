NAME
    BSON-Types - Hierarchy of BSON Types for BSON implementations to use

VERSION
    Version 0.1

SYNOPSIS
        package MyBSON::String;

        use base BSON::Types::String;

        sub new {

            my ($class, $str) = @_;
            bless { value => $str }, $class;
        }

        sub value {

            return $_[0]->{value};
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a basic hierarchy of BSON types that
    should be implemented by other modules. BSON modules that
    provide an encoder/decoder must implement the methods listed
    for the specific BSON type. The idea is that an encoder can accept
    any kind of BSON::Types::* and encode it properly.
